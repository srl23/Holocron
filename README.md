This is Holocron, a tool that uses SWAPI which the user can utilize to search for
various elements in the first seven Star Wars films. In the Star Wars universe, a Holocron is an object that records data which can be played back. They were originally intended to appear in the films, but instead appeared in more of the extended universe than anything.

With this application, the user can search for:

1. Characters
2. Planets
3. Starships
4. Species
5. Vehicles
6. Films

Each lookup contains various attributes that can be rendered onto the HTML page
and present the data to the user. For instance, looking up a character will not
only tell you their name that you looked up, but will also reveal information such
as their height, date of birth, species, and various physical characteristics.

The approach I took to this assignment was to get the search features to work first
and then focus on getting a basic design to work that would deliver on what the
intended goal of this project was. There was a lot of trouble shooting at this point
as I had conflicting ID names and did not realize it at the time, and spent plenty of
time making sure everything worked in the end as intended. Once that was done, my
next goal was to get the buttons to work to toggle the intended form on and off and
had it so that if another form was open, it would be hidden and toggle on the form
that was connected to the button the user clicked. The next step was to get a basic
image carousel into the assignment, which was edited to follow the black and yellow
color scheme that is associated with the Star Wars title crawl and display iconic
pictures from the films and characters. I was initially going to put it at the bottom, but concluded the user would likely not bother with it if they had to scroll
to use the carousel. After this, all that was left was to verify that the site had responsive design and some more minor changes had to be made.

And my efforts have led us to this end result, a site that delivers on its intended
goal of being a general lookup tool and unfortunately not much more. I had a plan to put a button in each film's result that would have played a CSS animated title crawl for that film but I was getting somewhat low on time and feared this would never get done if I added it in. Better to deliver on the goals than to fall to feature creep. The design needs a lot more work and polish, the work was not particularly difficult on it but it was extremely repetitive and somewhat tiring to find the errors that were made. In spite of that, working on this project was rewarding and each time I got something new to work on it and fixed another error it felt like I was improving in the end and seeing this work evolve in real time was enjoyable. I am likely going to come back to this over time and build on what I have done with it and make it closer to what my initial vision of it was.
